<!-- Mark up means we declare what we present to a user not how we present it. It is considered a 
to be a markup lanuage and not a programming language since it has no logic.-->

<!-- Basic structure of a html element
 Opening tags: <element>
      Content in between and 
Closing tags(same structure as the opening tag + a forward slash): </element>
          <element> content </element>
      -->
      <!-- Void elements are element that have self closing tags e.g. <img>, <meta>
      <link> and <input>
-->

<!--creating  a simple html page-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Hello!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
<!--Tag Meaning
<!DOCTYPE>
Defines the HTML version used in the document. In this case it is HTML5. It is case insensitive.
<html>
Opens the page. No markup should come after the closing tag (</html>). The lang attribute declares
the primary language of the page using the ISO language codes (en for English).
<head>
Opens the head section, which does not appear in the main browser window but mainly contains
information about the HTML document, called metadata. It can also contain imports from external
stylesheets and scripts. The closing tag is </head>.
<meta>
Gives the browser some metadata about the document. The charset attribute declares the character
encoding. Modern HTML documents should always use UTF-8, even though it is not a requirement. In
HTML, the <meta> tag does not require a closing tag.
<title>
The title of the page. Text written between this opening and the closing tag (</title>) will be
displayed on the tab of the page or in the title bar of the browser.
<body>
Opens the part of the document displayed to users, i.e. all the visible or audible content of a page. No
content should be added after the closing tag
.<h1>
A level 1 heading for the page.
HTML has six levels of headings
<h1> to <h6>
<p> Represents a common paragraph of text.
      There should be one <h1> element in an atricle and several h2 -h6 headings going down a
hierachal layer if possible -->
      <h1>Bigger font</h1>
      <h2>Sort of big font</h2>
      <h3>Big font</h3>
      <h4>Medium font</h4>
      <h5>Small font</h5>
      <h6>Little font</h6>
      <!--paragraphs
      <p>:defines a paragraph
      <br>: inserts a single line break
      <pre>: defines preformatted text-->
 <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Doloremque recusandae, voluptates soluta voluptatem odio iste optio beatae veritatis impedit in iusto nisi nesciunt cumque dolorum maiores reprehenderit quasi hic numquam!</p>
   <br>
   <p>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Reprehenderit voluptatibus ducimus facere omnis, nobis doloremque repellendus quam perferendis a eos! Libero eum nobis velit tempore excepturi dolor totam qui sapiente?</p>
     <br>
     <pre>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Iure reiciendis natus veritatis. Tempora porro exercitationem, enim beatae nobis temporibus quod explicabo nam repellat dolore in ipsum odit dolorum commodi a.</pre>
<!--With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed:-->
<p>This    is another    paragraph, extra    spaces will be removed    by browsers</p>

<!--Text formatting:
The <mark> element is used to highlight a specific part of a text.-->
      <p> This is a <mark>highlighted</mark> text.</p>

<!-- We use the <strong> or <b> element to show bold text(If you were to use <b> a text-to-speech program would not say the word(s) any differently than any of the other
words around it - you are simply drawing attention to them without adding any additional importance. By using
<strong>, though, the same program would want to speak those word(s) with a different tone of voice to convey
that the text is important in some way.)-->

<p> This is a <strong>Bold</strong> text.</p>
<p> This is a <b>Bold</b> text.</p>

<!--To italicize words, we use the <em> or <i> tags-->
      
<p> This is an <em>italicized</em> text.</p>
<p> This is an <i>italicized</i> text.</p>
<!--We use the <u> tag to underline text-->
<p> This is an <u>underlined</u> text.</p>
<!--We use the <abbr> tag to show abbreviated text-->
<p> This is an <abbr title="abbreviated">abb.</abbr> text.</p>
<!--The title attribute is used to give the full desription of the abbreviated text-->

<!--To mark text as inserted, we use the <ins> tag -->
      <p>This is an <ins> inserted</ins> text.</p>

<!--To mark deleted text, we use the <del> tag-->
      <p> This is a <del>deleted</del> text.</p>
<!--To strike through a text, we use the <s> tag-->
            <p> This is a text with a <s>strike through.</s></p>
<!--to write a superscript text, we use a <sup> tag while subscript text uses the 
      <sub> tag-->
      <p>log <sup>2</sup> <sub>10</sub></p>
